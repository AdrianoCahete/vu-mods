<!-- **IMPORTANT!**  

Delete this comment block after filling the template. The template accepts markdown on the body.  
Leave the `[MOD-NEW]` before the title and add your mod name after.  
To Update mod, change the title to `[MOD-UPDATE]` and just fill in the update values.

- `title` and `description` are strings. You don't need to put between quotes. The description is a small description.
- `releaseStatus` is the status of the mod. `alpha`, `beta` or `released` are accepted.
- `type` is the type of mod. Accepts `map`, `admin` and `game`
- `version` is the mod's version. Accepts any number on version schema (`x.y.z`)
- `sourceUrl` is the URL to mod's source code
- `downloadURL` is the URL to download the mod itself. If you are using some Git service, you can create a `Release` and point to that file.
- `faqUrl` is the URL to mod's thread on the Venice Unleashed forum. It's good to help users in there.

There are no "default" values. If you don't fill in the value, the key will be ignored on the website. The same occurs if the value is in an invalid schema.
